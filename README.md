#### The ChardScript programming language is easy to use and the Syntaxs are simple. Inspired by LuaScript and Syntax from BASIC and ShellScript. This is the place for you to learn how to use this programming language and learn.

In 2021, at that time the ChardScript programming language was named chard.js and used to create the Discord Bot. But then it failed to create a programming language because it was not considered a language. On August 19, 2021, the programming language was relaunched and is expected to be the simplest programming language.
